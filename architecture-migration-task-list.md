# Architecture Migration Task List

Last updated: 2026-04-25
Owner: Codex + Marc
Branch policy: dedicated implementation branch, no direct commits to `main`
Primary scope: record the completed migration from the former hybrid runtime to the current modular architecture

## Purpose

This file is the authoritative migration control document and session-to-session memory for the remaining runtime architecture work.

Goals:
- Keep runtime behavior parity while restructuring.
- Make core state the single source of truth.
- Keep systems modular, testable, and understandable.
- Reduce `src/main.js` to boot/wiring/orchestration instead of mixed ownership.

Non-goals:
- Full gameplay rewrite during migration.
- Visual redesign.
- Large feature additions unless needed to preserve behavior or unblock migration.

## Current Status

The migration is complete.

Current architecture state:
- Core store state is the authoritative runtime state model.
- Scheduler systems consume canonical state directly.
- UI controls emit commands and reflect state; they are not runtime truth.
- Renderer consumes resolved frame/runtime state and does not own gameplay/config state.
- `src/main.js` is still the largest single file, but it now acts primarily as composition/orchestration.
- App-level dependency shaping lives under `src/app/` instead of being expanded inline across `main.js`.
- migration-era wrapper layers that previously hid ownership are removed from active runtime paths.

## Target Architecture

Top-level module layout:
- `src/app/` bootstrap, mode bootstrap, dependency wiring
- `src/core/` app state, scheduler, commands, settings registry
- `src/render/` renderer, passes, GPU resources, render prep
- `src/sim/` time/weather/lighting/fog/cloud/water systems
- `src/gameplay/` entities, movement, pathfinding, map lifecycle, interaction runtime
- `src/ui/` bindings, panels, overlays, HUD, sync helpers
- map load/save and persistence adapters under the current owner modules in `src/gameplay/`
- point-light worker entry at `src/pointLightBakeWorker.js`, with orchestration under `src/render/`

End-state rules:
- Core state is the authoritative runtime state model.
- Scheduler systems consume canonical state directly.
- UI controls emit commands; they are not runtime truth.
- Renderer consumes resolved state; it does not own gameplay/config state.
- `src/main.js` remains a thin composition layer:
  - bootstrapping
  - renderer setup
  - input binding
  - command dispatch
  - frame orchestration

## Progress Rules

Status markers:
- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked

Execution rules:
- Only one major migration phase should be in progress at once.
- Keep behavior stable while changing ownership.
- After each ownership move, remove the old read/write path instead of leaving duplicates behind.
- Do not mark migration complete until the remaining migration-era ownership patterns are actually removed.

## Phase Overview

1. Architecture Baseline and Gap Mapping
2. Canonical State Contract Completion
3. Control/Input Ownership Migration
4. Simulation/System Ownership Migration
5. Render/Input Decoupling
6. Adapter Removal and Simplification
7. Verification and Documentation

- [x] P2.2 Define stable command surface for all user-driven state changes
  - [x] P2.2.1 Route mutable UI-backed settings through commands.

- [x] Shadow pipeline works.

## Completion Definition

Migration is only complete when all of the following are true:
- Core state is the authoritative runtime state model.
- Scheduler systems consume canonical state directly.
- Render loop does not rebuild core state from runtime snapshots each frame.
- DOM controls are not used as runtime truth.
- migration-era ownership assumptions are gone from active runtime paths.
- `src/main.js` is reduced to composition/orchestration rather than mixed ownership.
- Cycle-hour/time-of-day authority lives in core store state; UI/runtime helpers only proxy or reflect it.
- Active runtime source uses compatibility naming for JSON/UI apply fallbacks, not old migration-layer naming.

## Immediate Next Work

Post-migration work is normal maintenance:

- feature development
- targeted performance work if new issues are observed
- incremental naming cleanup where it improves readability

## Session Log

Detailed extraction history belongs in git log and code. This log only records
the final migration state.

- 2026-04-22 to 2026-04-24:
  - Established the migration plan, introduced core state/scheduler ownership,
    and moved major runtime domains out of the former monolithic `src/main.js`.
- 2026-04-25:
  - Completed canonical state ownership for settings, time, camera, gameplay,
    pathfinding, point lights, swarm, render FX, weather, and map lifecycle.
  - Removed obsolete migration wrappers from active runtime paths and moved
    app-level dependency shaping into `src/app/`.
  - Moved shader source to `src/render/shaders.js` and kept `src/main.js` as
    composition/orchestration.
  - Added architecture guard tests for direct store-mutation regressions,
    migration-era naming regressions, and core-owned cycle-hour behavior.
  - Confirmed the JS architecture suite passes with
    `node --test tests/*.test.js`.
