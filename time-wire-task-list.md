# Time Wire Task List

Last updated: 2026-04-24
Owner: Codex + Marc
Branch policy: dedicated implementation branch, no direct commits to `main`
Primary scope: complete the transition from hybrid time wiring to a fully migrated runtime architecture

## Purpose

This file is the implementation control document and session-to-session memory for the time-wiring feature and the remaining architecture migration needed to make it the final runtime model.

## Current Status

Important clarification:
- The time-wiring feature itself is largely implemented.
- The architecture migration is not complete.
- The runtime is currently hybrid.

Current hybrid structure:
- `src/main.js` still owns most live runtime state, DOM input reads, render orchestration, overlay drawing, and significant gameplay state.
- `src/core/frameSnapshot.js` has been removed.
- `runtimeCore.scheduler` systems run against that core state.
- `src/core/runtimeParityAdapter.js` has been removed.
- Core store updates now happen through commands, settings apply/bootstrap synchronization, and scheduler system updates.

Meaning:
- The newer core/scheduler path is active and real.
- The legacy runtime path is still the dominant owner.
- The adapter layers are gone, but some domains still retain DOM-backed helpers and duplicated ownership patterns.

So:
- Time wiring is not blocked.
- Full migration is the remaining strategic task.

## What Is Done

Implemented already:
- Fixed-step time router foundation.
- Routed timing for movement, swarm, clouds, water, and weather context.
- Queued movement instead of pathfinding teleport.
- Sim tick configuration and routing persistence.
- Swarm and cloud smoothing/interpolation.
- Water detached by default.
- Initial command/state/settings contract wiring.
- Targeted tests for tick math and movement queue behavior.

Done does not mean:
- core state is the only source of truth
- `main.js` no longer owns runtime state
- DOM controls are passive views
- frame snapshot / parity adapters are removable

## Migration Target

Target end state:
- Core state is the single source of truth for runtime state.
- Scheduler systems read canonical core state directly.
- UI controls dispatch commands into state instead of being read ad hoc by runtime code.
- Render code consumes already-resolved state instead of reading DOM inputs directly.
- `src/core/frameSnapshot.js` is removed.
- `src/core/runtimeParityAdapter.js` is removed.
- `src/main.js` becomes a thin composition layer:
  - bootstrapping
  - renderer setup
  - input binding
  - command dispatch
  - frame orchestration

## Progress Rules

Status markers:
- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked

Execution rules:
- Only one major migration phase should be in progress at once.
- Keep behavior stable while changing ownership.
- After each ownership move, remove the old read/write path instead of leaving duplicates behind.
- Do not mark migration done until adapter layers are removed from runtime.

## Phase Overview

1. Architecture Baseline and Gap Mapping
2. Canonical State Contract Completion
3. Control/Input Ownership Migration
4. Simulation/System Ownership Migration
5. Render/Input Decoupling
6. Adapter Removal
7. Verification and Documentation

## Detailed Task List

### Phase 1: Architecture Baseline and Gap Mapping

Dependencies: none

- [x] P1.1 Confirm current runtime is hybrid
  - [x] P1.1.1 Confirm `src/main.js` still owns live runtime state.
  - [x] P1.1.2 Confirm `src/core/frameSnapshot.js` still mirrors runtime into core store.
  - [x] P1.1.3 Confirm `src/core/runtimeParityAdapter.js` still mirrors some state back out.
- [x] P1.2 Capture migrated vs non-migrated ownership
  - [x] P1.2.1 Time routing foundation is in place.
  - [x] P1.2.2 Movement queue/tick execution is in place.
  - [x] P1.2.3 Render, DOM, and much of runtime state are still `main.js` owned.
- [x] P1.3 Create explicit ownership map for remaining migration
  - [x] P1.3.1 List all runtime domains still reading DOM inputs directly.
    - point-light editor draft controls still read DOM input values directly during editor interaction (`strength`, `intensity`, `heightOffset`, `flicker`, `flickerSpeed`).
    - swarm range normalization helpers still read DOM values to clamp/correct paired controls (`min/max height`, `follow zoom in/out`) before reflecting normalized values.
    - map/load-save and file-picker flows still read DOM/path inputs directly by design at event time.
    - note: runtime-hot render/system settings reads are now store-backed; remaining direct reads are mostly event-time UI/editor paths.
  - [x] P1.3.2 List all core state branches that are still snapshots instead of authoritative state.
    - `camera` is still runtime-driven (local `panWorld`/`zoom`) and mirrored into store; follow-camera path now explicitly syncs this mirror.
    - `gameplay.swarm.enabled/count/follow*` mirrors live swarm runtime (`swarmState`, follow locals) rather than being the sole simulation authority.
    - `gameplay.movement` is a movement-system runtime snapshot exposed into store for UI/scheduler integration.
    - `map.folderPath/loaded/size` is runtime/map-load driven and synchronized into store.
    - several transient editor/runtime states remain local-only (point-light editor draft/selection, cursor pointer transient, hover/path preview caches).
  - [x] P1.3.3 List all places where parity writes state back into runtime/DOM.

Exit criteria:
- Hybrid-state reality is documented.
- Remaining migration surface is explicit enough to sequence cleanly.

### Phase 2: Canonical State Contract Completion

## Dependency Map

- Phase 1 -> Phase 2
- Phase 2 -> Phase 3, Phase 4
- Phase 3 + Phase 4 -> Phase 5
- Phases 3, 4, 5 -> Phase 6
- Phase 6 -> Phase 7

Critical path:
- P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P4 -> P5 -> P6 -> P7

## Completion Definition

Migration is only complete when all of the following are true:
- Core state is the authoritative runtime state model.
- Scheduler systems consume canonical state directly.
- Render loop does not rebuild core state from runtime snapshots each frame.
- DOM controls are not used as runtime truth.
- `src/core/frameSnapshot.js` is unused and removed.
- `src/core/runtimeParityAdapter.js` is unused and removed.
- `src/main.js` is reduced to composition/orchestration rather than mixed ownership.

## Immediate Next Work

Recommended next sequence:
- [-] N1 Close remaining Phase 2 command-surface/state-contract work:
  - finish removing remaining DOM-primary dependencies in settings/control flows
  - complete ownership-boundary clarification across core/renderer/DOM
- [-] N2 Close explicit runtime ownership boundaries in Phase 4:
  - finish swarm/player ownership split so runtime mirrors are minimized and deliberate
  - close remaining point-light runtime helper ownership now that bake/editor/io paths are mostly extracted
- [-] N3 Continue Phase 5 extraction and reduce `main.js` further:
  - move remaining embedded render/gameplay orchestration out of `main.js`
  - collapse remaining thin wrappers whose only role is legacy naming shims after call-sites migrate
  - keep `main.js` focused on boot + wiring + frame orchestration

## Session Log

- 2026-04-22:
  - Created `time-wire-task-list.md` as the implementation planning document for fixed-step timing integration.
  - Revised the document to match the repository's migration-task style:
    - added status markers
    - added phase/task/subtask IDs
    - added dependency map
    - added compatibility checklist
    - added session log
  - Incorporated 2026-04-21 timing architecture notes:
    - fixed-step gameplay/simulation direction
    - `0.01h` base tick concept
    - queued action model
    - cost-to-hours movement example
    - rewind explicitly dropped
    - renderer vs fixed-step split
  - Updated the plan so map-level sim tick size is a task item under persistence/settings instead of an open-ended note.
  - Implementation started on branch `time-wiring`:
    - added core fixed-step time router foundation (`src/core/timeRouter.js`) and wired frame-time routing into scheduler context
    - added routing/tick state to core time state and command plumbing for `simTickHours` + per-system routing
    - replaced pathfinding teleport with movement queue scheduling + fixed-tick execution semantics
    - added initial routing UI/persistence controls for swarm/cloud/water and sim tick
    - split cloud/water shader time inputs so cloud can follow routed global time while water remains detached by default
    - added targeted tests for time-router math and movement queue tick execution
  - Confirmed baseline global timing mapping stays in place for now (`0.08 h/s` reference).
  - Clarified that time wiring is implemented on top of a hybrid runtime, not a fully completed architecture migration.
  - Replaced the old feature-only checklist with a migration-completion plan:
    - documented current hybrid architecture
    - defined final single-source-of-truth target
    - added ordered migration phases, subtasks, and dependencies
    - defined completion criteria for removing `frameSnapshot` and `runtimeParityAdapter`

  - Continued camera command-surface cleanup:
    - added `core/camera/setPose` command for direct pose updates (pan/zoom + optional overlay invalidation)
    - swarm follow camera path now uses command dispatch instead of direct `panWorld`/`zoom` mutation + ad hoc sync
    - removed now-unused local `syncCameraStateToStore()` helper after follow path migrated to command routing
  - Continued interaction ownership cleanup:

    - `main.js` now delegates point-light JSON parse/load/save/confirm state behavior through that controller
    - removed dead local runtime camera mirror (`panWorld`/`zoom`) after camera command/render paths became canonical-store driven
