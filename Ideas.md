# Ideas

- **flickering lights** - for some settings its ok, but the "chaos" effect is
  stupid, needs work
- **water based travel** (boat on water, is restricted to movement on water),
  we need to be close to it to enter, once entered we still technically control
  our char - but now its on water and movement is restricted to water (or board
  on a land tile)
- **animated movement**. Or rather movement tied to time-progress. Each step
  takes 0.01 hours (minimal timestep) * move-cost of the tile. (the one from
  dijkstra). This means that easy terrain is traveled fast, while challenging
  terrain takes a while. Once we clicked from the pathfinding - we do not
  teleport any longer, instead the chosen path is saved. The game turns from
  "stop" to "running" mode (time progresses - by how much can be chosen). And
  then we do each step, wait the appropriate time, do the next step and so on.
  Of course the action can be canceled at any time, which leaves the player at
  the current spot and stops time again?
- **info box** - on the side, should show height, slope etc.
- **details with sprites** (1 pixel equals 1 sprite i.e. 16x16 or 32x32)
  When we zoom close enough, each "material" like water, rock etc. (needs to be
  identified and mapped still) gets an assigned sprite (or group of sprites for
  variations). This is like a normal sprite-based map. But we overlay our
  normal colored map over this --> the sprite map just gives details once we
  zoom in close enough. Therefore we do not need to build a huge texture. Only
  like 100x100 sprites or so (depending on when we start to blend this in)
- **Animated sprites** : here i draw huge inspiration from "Songs of Syx" -
  check out the animations there, also the particle effects etc.
- **Particle Effects** : could be interesting to make a pixel art particle
  shader. For snow, rain, smoke, leaves blowing in the wind etc...
- **player gets light attached**, so once he is moving, the light moves with
  him.
- **Sun / Lighting / Atmosphere** : right now there is a hardcoded LUT for the
  sun settings (altitude, color), i would like a UI where i can put points on a
  linear axis and define what the settings are at those points - then they get
  interpolated / smoothed between them (linear, easing etc.; this could be tried
  as a smoothing parameter).
- **Map Overlays** : various info maps (height, slope, water, etc.) as overlays
  with adjustable ranges, so we can specify ranges that get shown and colored
  (for example only slopes above 51% in red)
- **Resource Gathering** Instead of individual items like in other survival
  sims, we just activate an "Activity" - we control the range and then its
  "auto-playing" basically. The character makes a brownian motion in that
  space, each new cell visited has a certain chance to find the resource
  (depending on the map data) - of course normal travel stuff applies.

## Weather System Brainstorm (2026-04-21)

- Goal: convincing, localized, moving weather on map scale (`~1x1 km` now,
  later up to `~4x4 km`), not physically exact simulation.
- Keep weather as a low-resolution field, not full-resolution per-pixel logic.
- Candidate base resolution for weather field:
  - `20x20` for `1000x1000` map as a valid starting point.
  - Allow higher (`32x32`, `64x64`) if seams/blocks are too visible.

- Localized fronts concept:
  - Animate a low-res field over time so patterns move across map.
  - Sample weather at world/map position in render path.
  - Use that sample to modulate cloud/fog/light/wind parameters locally.

- Important representation choice:
  - Avoid a single scalar noise -> hard weather bands.
  - Prefer a multi-channel weather texture/field:
    - `R`: cloud density/coverage
    - `G`: humidity/fog potential
    - `B`: precipitation or storm intensity
    - `A`: gust/front intensity (or spare channel)

- Wind model direction:
  - Use explicit wind, not implicit noise drift.
  - Combine:
    - global wind (`dir + speed`) for coherent world weather
    - local wind flow map for variation/channeling
  - Suggested flow map contract:
    - `RG`: local wind vector (packed XY direction)
    - `B`: local speed multiplier
    - `A`: gust/turbulence
  - Reuse same wind source for clouds now, later particles/smoke/fog advection.

- Terrain influence:
  - Keep small/modulatory (avoid overpowering base weather).
  - Examples:
    - slight fog retention in valleys
    - slight cloud/humidity bias on windward slopes

- Rendering integration idea:
  - In fragment shading, sample weather field by map UV.
  - Convert sample into local modifiers (clamped ranges) for:
    - cloud coverage/opacity/scroll
    - fog amount/tint bias
    - sun attenuation and ambient shift
    - optional water and particle coupling
  - Keep modulation caps to preserve scene coherence.

- Coherence/stability rules:
  - Smooth transitions (`smoothstep`, lerp, temporal damping).
  - Use different response times per channel (wind faster than fog/ambient).
  - Avoid flicker/twitch from per-frame random changes.

- Suggested first implementation order:
  - Build weather field texture + debug overlay.
  - Drive clouds only.
  - Then fog + lighting modulation.
  - Then expose wind to particle/gameplay systems.

## Survival/Activity Simulation Concept (2026-04-21)

- Core direction:
  - Avoid classic individual resource-node gameplay (no "see node, click node"
    loop).
  - Use broad ecological field simulation + player activity actions.
  - Example ecology: `grass/forage -> rabbits -> foxes`.

- Representation:
  - Per-species/resource density fields on a coarse grid (for example `32x32`
    or `64x64` over map).
  - Store values like:
    - `forageDensity`
    - `rabbitDensity`
    - `foxDensity`
  - Terrain/biome/water/altitude can bias carrying capacity per cell.

- Player activity loop:
  - Action-based gameplay (for example `Hunt Rabbits`) instead of explicit
    target picking.
  - During action, player moves automatically in local search pattern (biased
    random walk).
  - At each step:
    - sample local density
    - compute encounter probability
    - apply tool/skill/weather/time modifiers
    - roll yield
    - pay energy/time cost
  - Result: hunting in bad regions still works but yields poor return (energy
    efficiency gameplay).

- Stability guidelines:
  - Split timescales:
    - ecology updates slowly (coarse tick)
    - activity/movement updates faster
  - Avoid unstable oscillations:
    - logistic growth + carrying capacity
    - predation saturation cap
    - clamped min/max densities
    - mild diffusion between neighboring cells
    - low-amplitude noise only

- Prevent degenerate farming/exploits:
  - Local temporary depletion from repeated activity.
  - Gradual recovery over time.
  - Optional player "knowledge map" (learn good spots over repeated visits).

- Extensibility pattern:
  - Define activities as data templates:
    - `targetField`
    - `movementProfile`
    - `yieldModel`
    - `costModel`
    - `riskModel`
  - Reuse same framework for hunting, fishing, gathering, trapping, etc.

- Weather coupling:
  - Use weather as bounded modifiers (not hard overrides):
    - rain/fog reduce encounter visibility
    - seasonal/weather shifts affect reproduction/migration
  - Keep ecology readability: map-driven baseline remains primary.

## Zoom Detail Layer / Sprite Tilemap Idea (2026-04-21)

- Concept:
  - At higher zoom levels, blend in a sprite/tile detail map driven by map data
    classes.
  - Keep base terrain shading/tint partially visible to preserve macro
    variation and coherence.

- Data inputs:
  - Additional terrain-class map (for example `terrain_class.png`):
    - water, sand, dirt, grass, rock/mountain, etc.
  - Sprite atlas with one or more variants per terrain class.

- Alignment and rendering:
  - Sprite layer must remain pixel-perfect and locked to map coordinates.
  - Blend amount increases with zoom (`smoothstep` style).
  - Keep non-zero base tint/lighting contribution even at max zoom to avoid
    flat sprite-only look.

- Technical notes:
  - Use nearest-neighbor sampling for crisp pixel art.
  - Deterministic per-tile variant choice from coordinate hash to reduce
    repetition.
  - Consider transition/autotile rules between classes once baseline works.

- Incremental implementation order:
  - First pass: one sprite per class + zoom blend.
  - Second pass: variant sprites and transition edges.
  - Third pass: optional deeper lighting interaction for sprite layer.

## Functional Placement Over Full Construction (2026-04-21)

- Direction chosen:
  - Keep "alone vs nature" vibe (not full settlement simulator).
  - Prefer predefined functional blueprints over freeform tile-by-tile
    construction.

- Placement model:
  - Placeable objects (tent, firepit, shelter, trail marker, etc.) with:
    - sprite
    - footprint mask
    - walkability/block mask
    - gameplay modifiers (shelter/rest/crafting/logistics effects)

- Roads/trails:
  - Important strategic feature.
  - Lower movement/travel costs and improve route reliability.
  - Can be rendered as sprite overlays and integrated directly into path cost
    map.

- Extensibility:
  - Placement-object architecture can later expand into more detailed building
    if desired.
  - No need to commit to full construction system now.

## Scenario/Campaign/Sandbox Structure (2026-04-21)

- Map scalability insight:
  - With many maps possible, gameplay should be objective-driven, not endless
    by default.

- Proposed game modes:
  - Scenario mode (primary): self-contained objective + constraints +
    success/failure.
  - Campaign mode: sequence of scenarios with light connective framing.
  - Sandbox survival: open play for experimentation/modding.

- Example scenario goals:
  - Endurance: survive `N` seasons/years, survive a winter.
  - Expedition: reach summit/cross region/return alive.
  - Preparation: build shelter chain + stockpile thresholds before weather
    shift.
  - Ecology-aware: meet goals without collapsing local prey/resource field.
  - Weather-event survival: endure blizzard/drought/flood windows.

- Design principle:
  - Objective should drive system usage and decisions.
  - Avoid adding mechanics that do not create meaningful tradeoffs for scenario
    completion.

## Simulation Timing Architecture Notes (2026-04-21)

- Core gameplay timing direction:
  - Use fixed-step simulation for gameplay/systems (deterministic updates).
  - Pause/unpause and speed control drive how many simulation ticks are
    processed.

- Tick concept:
  - Example base sim step: `0.01` hours.
  - Runtime speed (`hours per second`) controls real-time progression rate.
  - Faster speed means more simulation steps processed per real second.

- Action queue model:
  - Entity actions (for example movement path) should be queued with
    precomputed costs/timings.
  - Movement edge example:
    - tile cost `45` => `0.45` in-game hours (`45 * 0.01`)
    - at `0.1 h/s` speed => `4.5s` real-time for that edge.

- Design decision:
  - Rewind requirement is dropped.
  - No need for full "state as pure function of time" architecture for
    everything.
  - Keep deterministic step/event simulation for history-dependent gameplay
    systems.

- Practical split:
  - gameplay/sim systems: fixed-step updates.
  - renderer: frame-rate rendering/interpolation and time-driven visual-only
    effects where useful.

## Particle System Direction (2026-04-21)

- Preferred direction:
  - Build custom particle system in-house (WebGL2), not heavy external library.
  - Keep style pixel-art-first and map-space aligned.

- Visual scope by zoom:
  - zoomed out: precipitation/macro atmosphere (rain/snow).
  - mid zoom: smoke, dust, leaves.
  - high zoom: micro effects (embers, insects, tiny fauna representations if
    desired).

- Representation:
  - Support both:
    - pixel/line particles (primary style)
    - optional sprite particles (atlas-based) for selected effects
  - Shared simulation core, different render material modes.

- System integration:
  - Weather/wind should drive particle motion/intensity.
  - Terrain/masks can gate spawn zones (water, slopes, biomes, near fires,
    etc.).

## In-Game Particle Builder (2026-04-21)

- Need:
  - Dedicated in-game editor for particle effects (like current atmosphere
    controls).
  - Start simple but design for extensibility.

- Effect asset model:
  - Effects as JSON assets/presets (not hardcoded).
  - One effect can contain multiple layers.

- Suggested layer parameters:
  - spawn rules (area/mask/rate)
  - lifetime/speed/size
  - wind influence
  - color/alpha over life
  - render mode (`pixel`, `line`, `sprite`)

- Builder capabilities:
  - Live preview on current map.
  - Add/remove/duplicate layers.
  - Save/load presets.
  - Test by zoom band and weather intensity.

- Extensibility guardrails:
  - Versioned schema.
  - Central validation/defaulting.
  - Backward compatibility when adding parameters later.
