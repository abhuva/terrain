# Time Wire Task List

Last updated: 2026-04-22
Owner: Codex + Marc
Branch policy: dedicated implementation branch, no direct commits to `main`
Primary scope: complete the transition from hybrid time wiring to a fully migrated runtime architecture

## Purpose

This file is the implementation control document and session-to-session memory for the time-wiring feature and the remaining architecture migration needed to make it the final runtime model.

## Current Status

Important clarification:
- The time-wiring feature itself is largely implemented.
- The architecture migration is not complete.
- The runtime is currently hybrid.

Current hybrid structure:
- `src/main.js` still owns most live runtime state, DOM input reads, render orchestration, overlay drawing, and significant gameplay state.
- `src/core/frameSnapshot.js` copies selected runtime state into the core store every frame.
- `runtimeCore.scheduler` systems run against that core state.
- `src/core/runtimeParityAdapter.js` writes some core state back into legacy runtime variables and DOM inputs.

Meaning:
- The newer core/scheduler path is active and real.
- The legacy runtime path is still the dominant owner.
- The adapter layers are still bridging the two.

So:
- Time wiring is not blocked.
- Full migration is the remaining strategic task.

## What Is Done

Implemented already:
- Fixed-step time router foundation.
- Routed timing for movement, swarm, clouds, water, and weather context.
- Queued movement instead of pathfinding teleport.
- Sim tick configuration and routing persistence.
- Swarm and cloud smoothing/interpolation.
- Water detached by default.
- Initial command/state/settings contract wiring.
- Targeted tests for tick math and movement queue behavior.

Done does not mean:
- core state is the only source of truth
- `main.js` no longer owns runtime state
- DOM controls are passive views
- frame snapshot / parity adapters are removable

## Migration Target

Target end state:
- Core state is the single source of truth for runtime state.
- Scheduler systems read canonical core state directly.
- UI controls dispatch commands into state instead of being read ad hoc by runtime code.
- Render code consumes already-resolved state instead of reading DOM inputs directly.
- `src/core/frameSnapshot.js` is removed.
- `src/core/runtimeParityAdapter.js` is removed.
- `src/main.js` becomes a thin composition layer:
  - bootstrapping
  - renderer setup
  - input binding
  - command dispatch
  - frame orchestration

## Progress Rules

Status markers:
- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked

Execution rules:
- Only one major migration phase should be in progress at once.
- Keep behavior stable while changing ownership.
- After each ownership move, remove the old read/write path instead of leaving duplicates behind.
- Do not mark migration done until adapter layers are removed from runtime.

## Phase Overview

1. Architecture Baseline and Gap Mapping
2. Canonical State Contract Completion
3. Control/Input Ownership Migration
4. Simulation/System Ownership Migration
5. Render/Input Decoupling
6. Adapter Removal
7. Verification and Documentation

### Phase 2: Canonical State Contract Completion

Dependencies: Phase 1

- [ ] P2.1 Make core state complete enough to become sole runtime authority
  - [ ] P2.1.1 Audit missing authoritative state branches for:
    - render FX controls
    - pathfinding settings
    - swarm settings
    - interaction mode
    - camera state
    - map/session state
  - [ ] P2.1.2 Remove any remaining dependence on reading those values primarily from DOM inputs.
  - [ ] P2.1.3 Ensure settings defaults/serialize/apply paths align with canonical core state shape.
- [ ] P2.2 Define stable command surface for all user-driven state changes
  - [ ] P2.2.1 Route all mutable UI-backed settings through commands.

  - [ ] P2.3.1 Core store owns persistent/config/runtime gameplay state.
  - [ ] P2.3.2 Renderer consumes resolved state but does not own it.
  - [ ] P2.3.3 DOM reflects state and emits commands, but is not authoritative.

- [ ] P4.3 Stop per-frame snapshot feeding
  - [ ] P4.3.1 Replace `updateCoreFrameSnapshot(...)` inputs with authoritative state access.
  - [ ] P4.3.2 Ensure scheduler update context only carries transient frame values (`nowMs`, `dtSec`, routed time), not mirrored runtime state.

## Dependency Map

- Phase 1 -> Phase 2
- Phase 2 -> Phase 3, Phase 4
- Phase 3 + Phase 4 -> Phase 5
- Phases 3, 4, 5 -> Phase 6
- Phase 6 -> Phase 7

Critical path:
- P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P4 -> P5 -> P6 -> P7

## Completion Definition

Migration is only complete when all of the following are true:
- Core state is the authoritative runtime state model.
- Scheduler systems consume canonical state directly.
- Render loop does not rebuild core state from runtime snapshots each frame.
- DOM controls are not used as runtime truth.
- `src/core/frameSnapshot.js` is unused and removed.
- `src/core/runtimeParityAdapter.js` is unused and removed.
- `src/main.js` is reduced to composition/orchestration rather than mixed ownership.

## Immediate Next Work

Recommended next sequence:
- [ ] N1 Finish Phase 1 ownership map.
- [ ] N2 Start Phase 2 by auditing missing canonical state branches.
- [ ] N3 Choose the first concrete ownership slice to migrate fully:
  - render FX controls
  - pathfinding controls
  - swarm controls

Recommended first slice:
- render FX controls

Reason:
- They have high runtime read frequency.
- They are a direct source of current snapshot/parity churn.
- They are lower-risk than camera/gameplay ownership changes.

## Session Log

- 2026-04-22:
  - Created `time-wire-task-list.md` as the implementation planning document for fixed-step timing integration.
  - Revised the document to match the repository's migration-task style:
    - added status markers
    - added phase/task/subtask IDs
    - added dependency map
    - added compatibility checklist
    - added session log
  - Incorporated 2026-04-21 timing architecture notes:
    - fixed-step gameplay/simulation direction
    - `0.01h` base tick concept
    - queued action model
    - cost-to-hours movement example
    - rewind explicitly dropped
    - renderer vs fixed-step split
  - Updated the plan so map-level sim tick size is a task item under persistence/settings instead of an open-ended note.
  - Implementation started on branch `time-wiring`:
    - added core fixed-step time router foundation (`src/core/timeRouter.js`) and wired frame-time routing into scheduler context
    - added routing/tick state to core time state and command plumbing for `simTickHours` + per-system routing
    - replaced pathfinding teleport with movement queue scheduling + fixed-tick execution semantics
    - added initial routing UI/persistence controls for swarm/cloud/water and sim tick
    - split cloud/water shader time inputs so cloud can follow routed global time while water remains detached by default
    - added targeted tests for time-router math and movement queue tick execution
  - Confirmed baseline global timing mapping stays in place for now (`0.08 h/s` reference).
  - Clarified that time wiring is implemented on top of a hybrid runtime, not a fully completed architecture migration.
  - Replaced the old feature-only checklist with a migration-completion plan:
    - documented current hybrid architecture
    - defined final single-source-of-truth target
    - added ordered migration phases, subtasks, and dependencies
    - defined completion criteria for removing `frameSnapshot` and `runtimeParityAdapter`
