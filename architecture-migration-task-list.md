# Architecture Migration Task List

Last updated: 2026-04-25
Owner: Codex + Marc
Branch policy: dedicated implementation branch, no direct commits to `main`
Primary scope: complete the remaining migration from the current hybrid runtime to the intended clean modular architecture

## Purpose

This file is the authoritative migration control document and session-to-session memory for the remaining runtime architecture work.

Goals:
- Keep runtime behavior parity while restructuring.
- Make core state the single source of truth.
- Keep systems modular, testable, and understandable.
- Reduce `src/main.js` to boot/wiring/orchestration instead of mixed ownership.

Non-goals:
- Full gameplay rewrite during migration.
- Visual redesign.
- Large feature additions unless needed to preserve behavior or unblock migration.

## Current Status

Important clarification:
- The time-wiring feature itself is largely implemented.
- The architecture migration is not complete.
- The runtime is currently hybrid.

Current hybrid structure:
- `src/main.js` still owns too much live runtime state, setup wiring, and domain orchestration.
- The old per-frame bridge layers are already removed from active runtime usage:
  - `src/core/frameSnapshot.js`
  - `src/core/runtimeParityAdapter.js`
- `runtimeCore.scheduler` systems are active and real.
- Core store updates now happen through commands, settings apply/bootstrap synchronization, and scheduler/system/runtime sync helpers.

Meaning:
- The newer core/scheduler path is active.
- The legacy runtime path is still the dominant owner in several domains.
- Migration is no longer about introducing the architecture foundation; it is about finishing ownership transfer and simplification.

## Target Architecture

Top-level module layout:
- `src/app/` bootstrap, mode bootstrap, dependency wiring
- `src/core/` app state, scheduler, commands, settings registry
- `src/render/` renderer, passes, GPU resources, render prep
- `src/sim/` time/weather/lighting/fog/cloud/water systems
- `src/gameplay/` entities, movement, pathfinding, map lifecycle, interaction runtime
- `src/ui/` bindings, panels, overlays, HUD, sync helpers
- `src/io/` map load/save and persistence adapters
- `src/workers/` worker wrappers and protocols

End-state rules:
- Core state is the authoritative runtime state model.
- Scheduler systems consume canonical state directly.
- UI controls emit commands; they are not runtime truth.
- Renderer consumes resolved state; it does not own gameplay/config state.
- `src/main.js` remains a thin composition layer:
  - bootstrapping
  - renderer setup
  - input binding
  - command dispatch
  - frame orchestration

## Progress Rules

Status markers:
- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked

Execution rules:
- Only one major migration phase should be in progress at once.
- Keep behavior stable while changing ownership.
- After each ownership move, remove the old read/write path instead of leaving duplicates behind.
- Do not mark migration complete until the remaining bridge-era ownership patterns are actually removed.

## Phase Overview

1. Architecture Baseline and Gap Mapping
2. Canonical State Contract Completion
3. Control/Input Ownership Migration
4. Simulation/System Ownership Migration
5. Render/Input Decoupling
6. Adapter Removal and Simplification
7. Verification and Documentation

## Completion Definition

Migration is only complete when all of the following are true:
- Core state is the authoritative runtime state model.
- Scheduler systems consume canonical state directly.
- Render loop does not rebuild core state from runtime snapshots each frame.
- DOM controls are not used as runtime truth.
- Bridge-era ownership assumptions are gone from active runtime paths.
- `src/main.js` is reduced to composition/orchestration rather than mixed ownership.

## Immediate Next Work

- [-] N1 Finish remaining Phase 2 command-surface side-effect consistency work (`P2.2.3`) and close `P2.2`.
- [-] N2 Close explicit runtime ownership boundaries in Phase 4, especially swarm/player/point-light sync + remaining duplication between `stateSync` and `swarmStoreSync`.
- [-] N3 Continue Phase 5 extraction and simplify `main.js` only when it improves ownership clarity, not line count alone.

## Session Log

Keep this section short. Detailed extraction history belongs in git log and code, not here.

- 2026-04-22:
  - Established the active migration plan around the hybrid runtime and the final state-driven architecture target.
- 2026-04-23:
  - Removed active reliance on the old bridge layers and moved a large amount of settings/binding/runtime composition out of `main.js`.
- 2026-04-24:
  - Fixed the camera-transform regression that broke terrain interaction and clarified swarm/player/point-light ownership in several hotspots.
- 2026-04-25:
  - Continued Phase 4/5 ownership work:
    - grouped store-sync and runtime-state access through focused facades/runtimes
    - hardened startup sequencing after lazy-facade TDZ regressions
    - `main.js` remains the largest integration surface, so migration is still incomplete
  - Continued Phase 2/4 command-ownership cleanup:
    - `core/pointLights/setLiveUpdate` now routes through runtime sync (`syncPointLightsStateToStore`) instead of in-command direct store mutation, with fallback retained for compatibility
  - Continued Phase 2/4 command-ownership cleanup:
    - cursor-light command handlers now route state writes through runtime sync (`syncCursorLightStateToStore`) instead of owning the `gameplay.cursorLight` mutation inline, with fallback retained for compatibility
  - Continued Phase 5 `main.js` orchestration cleanup:
    - removed pass-through fallback-image/map-size/image-data wrappers and wired setup runtimes directly to module/runtime APIs
  - Continued Phase 2/4 command-ownership cleanup:
    - `core/swarm/settingsChanged` now routes swarm settings patches through runtime sync (`patchSwarmSettingsToStore`) instead of owning the `gameplay.swarm` mutation inline, with fallback retained for compatibility
  - Continued Phase 2/4 command-ownership cleanup:
    - `core/renderFx/changed` now routes simulation knob section writes through runtime sync (`patchSimulationKnobSectionToStore`) instead of owning `simulation.knobs` mutation inline, with fallback retained for compatibility
    - `core/time/setCycleSpeed`, `core/time/setSimTickHours`, and `core/time/setRouting` now route store writes through runtime sync (`setCycleSpeedToStore`, `setSimTickHoursToStore`, `setTimeRoutingModeToStore`) instead of owning direct `clock/systems.time` mutation inline, with fallback retained for compatibility
  - Continued Phase 2/4 command-ownership cleanup:
    - `core/setMode`, camera pose updates, and `core/time/setHour` now route store writes through runtime sync (`setModeToStore`, `setCameraPoseToStore`, `setCycleHourUiToStore`) instead of owning direct `mode/camera/ui` mutation inline, with fallback retained for compatibility
  - Continued Phase 2/4 command-ownership cleanup:
    - pathfinding command handlers in `interactionCommands` now route pathfinding state patch/sync writes through runtime sync (`patchPathfindingStateToStore`, `syncPathfindingStateToStore`) instead of owning direct `gameplay.pathfinding` mutation inline, with fallback retained for compatibility
  - Continued Phase 6 simplification:
    - removed migrated fallback mutation branches in `registerMainCommands` and `interactionCommands` for mode/camera/time/render-fx/swarm/point-light/cursor-light/pathfinding command flows so those paths now use canonical runtime sync only
    - moved direct gameplay helper store writes (`interactionModeController`, `playerRuntimeBinding`, `movementStoreSyncRuntime`) behind shared `stateSync` helpers so mutation ownership is centralized
    - removed stale command-handler `ctx` dependencies in migrated paths so command signatures now reflect command+runtime-sync ownership instead of direct store ownership
    - moved `swarmFollowRuntimeState` follow-index/target store mutation behind shared swarm sync (`patchSwarmSettingsToStore`), leaving gameplay `store.update` concentrated in sync-focused modules (`stateSync`, `swarmStoreSync`)
    - added architecture guard coverage (`tests/architectureOwnershipGuards.test.js`) to detect regressions if direct `ctx.store.update` or helper-level `store.update` returns in migrated command/gameplay modules
  - Continued Phase 4/6 ownership cleanup:
    - moved swarm store mutation helpers (`syncSwarmFollowToStore`, `syncSwarmRuntimeStateToStore`, `syncSwarmStateToStore`, `patchSwarmSettingsToStore`) behind shared `stateSync` ownership, leaving `swarmStoreSync` focused on swarm snapshot/diff helpers
    - fixed the `core/cursorLight/setGizmo` command regression introduced during the runtime-sync refactor (`syncCursorLightToStore()` no longer references an undefined `ctx`)
  - Continued Phase 4/5 `main.js` ownership cleanup:
    - removed the lazy `mainRuntimeStateFacade` / `runtimeSyncFacade` proxy layer from `main.js`
    - rewired command/system/swarm integration call sites to use concrete bindings/runtimes directly (`mainRuntimeStateBinding`, `playerRuntimeBinding`, `movementSystem`, `swarmRuntime`)
    - removed now-dead `main.js` alias helpers that only existed to feed those facades
  - Continued Phase 4/5 binding cleanup:
    - removed duplicate `mainRuntimeStateBinding` construction from the swarm UI assembly path; swarm UI now consumes the same lazily-created binding instance owned by `main.js`
    - replaced the `mainRuntimeStateSetupRuntime` wrapper with direct `createMainRuntimeStateBinding(...)` usage in `main.js`
    - deleted dead adapter modules `mainRuntimeStateSetupRuntime.js`, `mainRuntimeStateFacadeRuntime.js`, and `runtimeSyncFacadeRuntime.js`
  - Continued Phase 4/5 binding cleanup:
    - removed the remaining lazy `getMainRuntimeStateBinding()` accessor from `main.js`; `mainRuntimeStateBinding` is now instantiated once and passed directly where needed
    - updated `mainRuntimeStateBinding` to resolve cursor-light state and `stopSwarmFollow` through getter-style dependencies, removing startup-order pressure from `main.js`
    - removed the remaining swarm-UI `getMainRuntimeStateBinding` indirection so the swarm UI facade/runtime now consume the concrete `mainRuntimeStateBinding` object directly
  - Continued Phase 5 orchestration extraction:
    - moved the swarm integration composition block out of `main.js` into `src/app/swarmIntegrationSetupRuntime.js`
    - grouped swarm gameplay composition, settings assembly wiring, swarm render setup, and interaction facade setup behind one app-level assembly module
    - `main.js` now consumes that assembled runtime instead of directly composing `createSwarmGameplayRuntime`, `createSettingsAssemblyRuntime`, `createSwarmRenderSetupRuntime`, and `createInteractionFacadeSetupRuntime` inline
  - Continued Phase 5 orchestration extraction:
    - moved swarm-cursor pointer wiring, pathfinding runtime/label setup, and render-FX UI setup out of `main.js` into `src/app/interactionUiSetupRuntime.js`
    - `main.js` now consumes assembled interaction/UI bindings instead of directly composing `createSwarmCursorPointerSetupRuntime`, `createPathfindingRuntimeBinding`, `createPathfindingLabelBindingRuntime`, and `createRenderFxUiSetupRuntime` inline
  - Continued Phase 5 orchestration extraction:
    - moved overlay setup, resize wiring, and frame-loop composition out of `main.js` into `src/app/renderShellSetupRuntime.js`
    - `main.js` now consumes assembled render-shell wiring instead of directly composing `createOverlaySetupRuntime`, `resizeViewport`, and `createFrameLoopBindingRuntime` inline
  - Continued Phase 5 orchestration extraction:
    - moved main bindings setup, default-map autoload kickoff, and startup/render kickoff out of `main.js` into `src/app/appShellLifecycleRuntime.js`
    - `main.js` now hands those lifecycle responsibilities to one app-level shell instead of directly calling `runMainBindingsSetup`, `tryAutoLoadDefaultMapRuntime`, and `runMainAppStartup`
  - Continued Phase 6 simplification:
    - removed the no-op `uiFacadeSetupRuntime.js` adapter layer and had `main.js` consume `uiRuntimeFacade` directly

    - moved the large `bindings` payload passed into `runAppShellLifecycleRuntime(...)` out of `main.js` into `src/app/mainBindingsLifecycleAssemblyRuntime.js`
    - `main.js` still provides the concrete UI/runtime handlers and DOM elements, but the main binding lifecycle dependency object is no longer assembled inline at the call site

  - Continued Phase 5/6 orchestration cleanup:
    - finished the map-lighting app-layer extraction by collapsing the remaining `createMapLightingAssemblyRuntime(createMapLightingAssemblyRuntimeDeps(...))` call-site literal into `src/app/mapLightingAssemblyRuntime.js`
    - `main.js` now calls a single app-level `createMapLightingSetupRuntime(...)` entry point instead of shaping the large flat map-lighting payload inline
  - Continued Phase 5/6 orchestration cleanup:
    - finished the swarm-UI app-layer extraction by collapsing the remaining `createSwarmUiRuntimeBinding(createSwarmUiAssemblyRuntime(...))` call-site literal into `src/app/swarmUiAssemblyRuntime.js`
    - `main.js` now calls a single app-level `createSwarmUiSetupRuntime(...)` entry point instead of shaping the large swarm-UI payload inline
  - Continued Phase 5/6 orchestration cleanup:

  - Continued Phase 5/6 orchestration cleanup:
    - moved the default-map bootstrap and camera-binding setup payloads out of `main.js` into `src/app/bootstrapFeatureAssemblyRuntime.js`
    - `main.js` now initializes fallback map images and camera binding through app-level setup helpers instead of assembling those payloads inline
  - Continued Phase 6 ownership/name cleanup:
    - removed more bridge-era handoff names that no longer reflected real ownership:
      - `gameplay/mapLightingAssemblyRuntime.js` now exposes `pointLightApi` instead of `pointLightFacade`
      - `app/swarmIntegrationAssemblyRuntime.js` / `app/swarmIntegrationSetupRuntime.js` now use `interactionContext`, `interactionModeBinding`, `mainInteractionBindings`, `swarmOverlayRuntime`, and `updateInfoPanel` instead of old facade/runtime wrapper labels
      - `main.js` now consumes those direct-owner names, reducing migration-era naming noise without changing behavior
  - Continued Phase 7 verification:
    - replaced the remaining facade-era tests with current-owner coverage:
      - `tests/mainRuntimeStateFacadeRuntime.test.js` -> `tests/mainRuntimeStateBinding.test.js`
      - `tests/runtimeSyncFacadeRuntime.test.js` -> `tests/swarmRuntime.test.js`
