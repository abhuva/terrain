# Architecture Migration Task List

Last updated: 2026-04-21
Owner: Codex + Marc
Branch policy: dedicated migration branch, no direct commits to `main`
Scope: migrate prototype to clean/modular architecture without losing current behavior

## Purpose

This file is the migration control document and external memory for session-to-session continuity.

Goals:
- Keep runtime behavior parity while restructuring.
- Make systems modular, testable, and moddable.
- Support future growth (weather simulation, gameplay loops, entities, crafting, survival).

Non-goals:
- Full gameplay rewrite during architecture migration.
- Visual redesign.
- Large shader feature additions unless needed for parity.

## Progress Rules

Status markers:
- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked

Execution rules:
- Only one major phase in progress at once.
- Every completed subtask must include a short note in the "Session Log" section.
- No new feature work until Phase 5 is complete (except migration-critical fixes).

## Target Architecture (Reference)

Top-level module layout:
- `src/app/` bootstrap, mode bootstrap, dependency wiring
- `src/core/` app state, scheduler, events/commands, settings registry
- `src/render/` renderer + render passes + GPU resource manager
- `src/sim/` simulation systems (time/weather/lighting/fog/cloud/water drivers)
- `src/gameplay/` entities, movement, pathfinding, activities
- `src/ui/` panel bindings, HUD, overlays, debug tooling
- `src/io/` map load/save, json persistence adapters (browser + tauri)
- `src/workers/` worker wrappers and protocols

Core contracts:
- State-driven runtime (UI writes commands, systems update state, renderer consumes state).
- Ordered scheduler update pipeline.
- Render pass interfaces with explicit inputs/outputs.
- Versioned settings schema + validation per subsystem.
- Mode capabilities: `dev`, `gameplay`, `hybrid`.

## Phase Overview

1. Baseline & Safety Nets
2. Core Runtime Foundation
3. Render Pipeline Extraction
4. UI Decoupling & Mode Capabilities
5. Simulation Systemization
6. Gameplay Foundation Extraction
7. Hardening & Documentation

## Detailed Task List

### Phase 1: Baseline & Safety Nets

Dependencies: none

- [ ] P1.1 Capture behavior baseline
  - [ ] P1.1.1 Record current key workflows (map load, LM/PF, save/load settings, water controls).
  - [ ] P1.1.2 Capture baseline screenshots for key scenarios (day, night, water debug, fog/cloud on/off).
  - [ ] P1.1.3 Record perf baseline (fps estimate + expensive operations timing notes).
- [ ] P1.2 Add migration guard checks
  - [ ] P1.2.1 Add lightweight smoke script/checklist doc for parity verification.
  - [ ] P1.2.2 Add "known acceptable diffs" list (what can change slightly vs must stay exact).
- [ ] P1.3 Branch setup and migration discipline
  - [ ] P1.3.1 Confirm dedicated migration branch.
  - [ ] P1.3.2 Define commit cadence (small logical commits, no mega dump).

Exit criteria:
- Baseline artifacts captured and referenced.
- Parity checklist exists and is runnable manually.

### Phase 2: Core Runtime Foundation

Dependencies: Phase 1

- [ ] P2.1 Create core folders and initial modules
  - [ ] P2.1.1 Add `src/core/state.js` (single source of truth).
  - [ ] P2.1.2 Add `src/core/scheduler.js` (ordered system update pipeline).
  - [ ] P2.1.3 Add `src/core/commands.js` (UI intent -> state mutation API).
  - [ ] P2.1.4 Add `src/core/settingsRegistry.js`.
- [ ] P2.2 Move global mutable runtime data into state store
  - [ ] P2.2.1 Camera/time/mode state.

### Phase 3: Render Pipeline Extraction

Dependencies: Phase 2

- [ ] P3.1 Build render module skeleton
  - [ ] P3.1.1 Add `src/render/renderer.js`.
  - [ ] P3.1.2 Add `src/render/resources.js` (textures/FBO/program handles).

  - [ ] P3.4.1 `FrameRenderState` object from core state.
  - [ ] P3.4.2 Remove direct DOM reads from render upload path.

Exit criteria:
- Main render loop calls renderer API, not inline GL blocks.
- Pass boundaries are explicit and testable in isolation.

### Phase 4: UI Decoupling & Mode Capabilities

Dependencies: Phase 2 (can overlap partially with Phase 3)

- [ ] P4.1 Extract panel bindings
  - [ ] P4.1.1 `src/ui/bindings/waterPanel.js`

  - [ ] P4.2.1 UI controls dispatch typed commands.
  - [ ] P4.2.2 Command handlers mutate core state.
- [ ] P4.3 Mode capability layer
  - [ ] P4.3.1 Define capabilities for `dev`, `gameplay`, `hybrid`.

- [ ] P5.3 Settings schema normalization
  - [ ] P5.3.1 Move subsystem defaults/validate/serialize/apply into settings registry.

  - [ ] P7.3.2 Verify no duplicate sources of truth remain.

Exit criteria:

## Dependency Map (High Level)

- Phase 1 -> Phase 2
- Phase 2 -> Phase 3, 4, 5, 6
- Phase 3 + 4 + 5 -> Phase 7
- Phase 6 -> Phase 7

Critical path:
- P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P5 -> P7

## Parity Checklist (Must Pass Before Merge)

- [ ] Default map auto-load still works.
- [ ] Manual map load (folder/path) still works.
- [ ] Save/Load all JSON still works (pointlights, lighting, parallax, interaction, fog, clouds, waterfx, npc).
- [ ] Day/night cycle behavior and sliders match baseline intent.
- [ ] Shadow pipeline works (including blur).
- [ ] Point lights create/edit/delete/bake with worker fallback.
- [ ] Pathfinding preview/click move mode still works.
- [ ] Water FX controls still work (including downhill invert/boost/tint).
- [ ] Dev tools visibility and interaction mode toggles remain functional.

## Testing Strategy (Pragmatic)

Mandatory:
- Settings roundtrip tests for each subsystem.
- Deterministic math tests for core sim helpers.
- Manual visual parity checklist.

Optional early, required before final merge:
- Screenshot comparison harness for 5-10 canonical scenes.
